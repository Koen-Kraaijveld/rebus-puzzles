To solve this rebus puzzle, you need to think creatively and consider the possible meanings of the text.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) ((up and about)).\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that \"ABOUT\" can be interpreted as a preposition meaning \"on the subject of\" or \"concerning\". When you put two \"ABOUT\"s together, it can be interpreted as \"on the subject of on the subject of\" or \"concerning concerning\". This can be rephrased as \"up and about\", which means to be active and engaged in daily activities."

To solve this rebus puzzle, you need to think creatively and consider the possible meanings of the symbols.\n\nThe word \"EKAT\" could be interpreted as \"EKAT\" itself, which doesn't make sense. However, if you consider the number \"-2\" as a modifier, it could be interpreted as \"EKAT\" minus two letters.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) cross to take up - This doesn't fit the pattern of the letters and the number.\n(B) cross out - This fits the pattern. If you take the \"EKAT\" and cross out two letters, you are left with \"EK\" which is \"EKAT\" minus two letters.\n(C) off one's cross - This doesn't fit the pattern of the"

The \"TAKE\" could imply the action of taking or removing.

This phrase is not a common idiom or phrase, so it doesn't match any of the options provided. However, if we consider the phrase \"TWENTY DOZEN\" as a whole, it could be interpreted as \"twenty dozen of something\", which is a way to say \"a lot of something\". This interpretation is similar to the phrase \"a dime a dozen\", which means something is very common or not valuable. So, the closest match to the image's text would be (A) ((a dime a dozen))."
