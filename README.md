# A Benchmark to Evaluate the Lateral Thinking Skills of Visual Question Answering Models through Rebus Puzzles
This repository presents a benchmark of rebus puzzles designed to challenge the lateral thinking skills of visual question answering (VQA) models. 

This repository has been submitted in conjunction with a thesis for the VU Master of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence. The draft version of the thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/thesis_draft.pdf).

## Data Selection and Collection

---

The following files consist of the raw data scraped, downloaded or manually collected (custom) to be used as input for our puzzle generation pipeline:
- Compound words: [source](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/dc3b9033-14d0-48d7-b6fa-6398a30e61e4) + [custom](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/saved/custom_compounds.csv) 
- Idioms/phrases: [source](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/saved/idioms_raw.json) + [custom](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/saved/custom_phrases.json)
- Icons: [source](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/saved/icons_v2.json)
- Homophones: [source](https://github.com/Koen-Kraaijveld/rebus-puzzles/blob/main/saved/homophones_v2.json)
